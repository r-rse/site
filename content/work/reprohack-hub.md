I started building this site over a weekend following a django girls tutorial on building a blog in Django. While out of my comfort zone using python, I really appreciated the Django framework for a dynamic site, especially handling users inputing data. 

A few months later, after getting it to a decent prototype stage and editing a free website template for the front end, I thankfully received some funding from the N8 CIR to get some developer help on it.

We launched the site in November 2021 and are extremely happy with it's ability to facilitate all ReproHack activities and with the good feedback we've had from users to the site (who have also been extremely helpful in reporting bugs!)
