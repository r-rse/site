Skilled in data science and software development in R, its **my research software engineering experience in an academic setting that distinguishes my offering**. I'm **acutely aware of researchers needs** as well of the **importance of researchers having access to RSE skills** and support. 

Importantly, my **firm belief in the power of open sourcing science to improve robustness, transparency and reusability and supercharge the impact of scientific research drives all aspects of my work**.

While open for business from all sectors, I particularly welcome enquiries from academics, especially those who don't have access to RSEs through their institution or even nationally.
