Skilled in data science and software development in R, its **our research software engineering experience in an academic setting that sets us apart**. We are **acutely aware of researchers needs** as well of the **importance of researchers having access to such skills** and support. 

Importantly, our **firm belief in the power of open sourcing science** to improve robustness, transparency and reusability and supercharge the impact of scientific research drives all aspects of our work.

While open for business from all sectors, we particularly welcome enquiries from academics, especially those who don't have access to RSEs through their institution or even nationally.
