From making it easier to build on your work and boosting its impact to an increasing demand for greater transparency in research, **investing in the quality of the real workhorses of modern research, your code and data, is becoming critically important**. 

While the UK Research Software Engineering (RSE) movement, has shone a spotlight on this fact and fought for retention of the required skills in academia by advocating for the RSE career path, **access to RSE support is still far from ubiquitous**, especially outside the UK.

This is where I can help! After **five years as an RSE in one of the first and most successful RSE teams in the UK at the University of Sheffield and 12 years programming in R, I now offer our services worldwide as an R RSE consultant**.

Have a look at the services I provide and let me help you do more with your research code and data!
