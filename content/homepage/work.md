From making it easier to build on your work and boosting it's impact to increasing requirements for transparency in research, **making the most of your real research workhorses, your code and data is can make a huge difference to your research**. 

While the Research Software Engineering (RSE) movement, initiated in the UK, has shone a spotlight on this fact and fought for retention of the required skills in academia by advocating for the RSE career path, **access to RSE support is still far from ubiquitous**, especially outside the UK.

This is where we come in! After **five years as an RSE in one of the first and most successful RSE teams in the UK at the University of Sheffield, we now offer our services worldwide as consultants**.

Have a look at the services we provide and let us help you do more with your research code and data!
