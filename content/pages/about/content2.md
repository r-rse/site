An important part of my work focused on capacity building through training, mentoring and advocacy on best research software engineering practices. I developed and taught a number of acclaimed courses, in particular a postgraduate course on Research Project and Data management in R and a course in version control through git & GitHub while my advocacy work included a number of high profile invited talks including a keynote at User2020.

Overall, her passion lies in helping researchers and the research community as a whole make better use of the workhorses of modern digital research, code and data, and in spreading the word about the joys of R.

I holds a PhD in Marine Macroecology from the University of Sheffield and a 1st Class BSc (Honours) degree in Marine Biology and Oceanography from the University of Plymouth.
