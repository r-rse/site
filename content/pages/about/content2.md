An important part of my work focused on capacity building through training, mentoring and advocacy on best research software engineering practices. I developed and taught a number of well received courses, in particular a postgraduate course on Research Project and Data management in R and a course in version control through git & GitHub while my advocacy work included a number of invited talks including a keynote at User2020.

Overall, my passion lies in helping researchers and the research community as a whole make better use of their code and data and spreading the word about the joys of R!
