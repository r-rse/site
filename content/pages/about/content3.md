I've contributed to a number open source software, Open Science communities and initiatives.

I am a software review editor for [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), a 2019 Software Sustainability Institute Fellow, founding member of the ReproHack project and main developer of the ReproHack Hub (https://www.reprohack.org/). I've also contributed to communities like the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab), the [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) and mentored on the [Open Life Sciences](https://openlifesci.org/ols-3) program.
