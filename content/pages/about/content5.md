After a very long time in the UK, in 2022 I returned home to Greece. I'm now based on Syros Island, the administrative center of the Cyclades in the South Aegean. I'm happy to travel but likely to perform most work remotely. I am also happy to host you events here so do consider Syros for your next summer school location!
