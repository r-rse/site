I'm an experienced Research Software Engineering, specialising in the statistical programming language R. I have 14 years of experience using R to compile, manipulate, analyse data and 7 years as a data scientist / research software engineer. I spent the last 5 years with one of the first and most successful RSE teams in the UK at the University of Sheffield, working with researchers to build more robust analysis pipelines and software, promote best practice in research programming and digital resource management and facilitate the shift to more open, transparent and collaborative research culture.

<br>

Software development work during this time was diverse, spanned all faculties and ranged from developing complex data analysis pipelines, building custom R packages from analysis code, developing shiny applications to provide access to and enable exploration of research data and results to accompany publications, packaging data and metadata for publication and providing consultation on how research groups can improve their own analysis and result reporting pipelines.
