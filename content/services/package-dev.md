**What if your code is something you or others might want to use?** Despite being historically underappreciated in academia, software is increasingly gaining recognition as an impactful and important research output. Whether as a dependency for other projects or something that has applicability for a wider community of users, bundling up your code into an R package is the best way to make your code more reusable, accessible and robust. 

### Benefits of R package structure

Creating a package out of your code allows us to leverage R software development tools including tools for testing, documenting, distributing, maintaining and installing functionality. It can also contribute to reproducibility through formal package versioning.

### What we can offer

We can help in all aspects of package development, whether building functionality from scratch to your specification or refactoring your code into an R package. More specifically, we can implement:


* Code modularisation, generalisation and function development
* Code testing and validation
* Runtime checks, assertions and exception handling
* Documentation (functions, long form vignettes, websites)
* Version control and transparent code sharing (publically or privately) through online repositories
* Continuous integration
