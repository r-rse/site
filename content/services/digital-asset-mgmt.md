Organising your team around convention can be a critical part of doing more with your code and data.

- Team mates trying to collaborate find other people's work hard to access and understand

## Organise your data, code and ways of working.

- Decide on a framework for storage, cataloguing and archiving
- Centralise assets
- Build convention on how they are produced and used.
- Onboard and offboard

## The power of convention

{{< blockquote source="**Jenny Bryan** on [Project-oriented workflows](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)">}}

Itâ€™s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.

For example, agreeing on variable names across datasets, on file formats, file naming, folder structure and organisation can help interoperability of teammates work immensely. It can help team members navigate your team assets with ease...including their own work.

## Documentation = the heart of a community of practice.


Good documentation to power a community of practice around your team's work

## Tools, Templating and automation

The powerful thing about developing and documenting convention is that it allows you to build tools, templates and automation around it!

From checklists, GitHub Issue and Pull Request templates to guide the team through action, parametarised Rmarkdown or Quarto reports to reusable processing or analysis pipelines, consistent ways of working and producing digtal assets can make their reuse much easier.

Conversely templating and automation which includes important checks can ensure help make it easier to ensure conventions are followed!

A great example of convention powering automation and templating is the `usethis` package. It's a veritable treasure trove for setting up the repetitive infrastructure and files an R package or project depends.
