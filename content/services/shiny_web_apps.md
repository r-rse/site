Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.


Shiny apps are a great option if you:

* Have a large data set you'd like to allow users to navigate. You can also allow users to add functionality to extract data.
* **Explore the behaviour of models**: Shiny apps are a great way of allowing using to explore a model's parameter space and the resulting outputs. Whether in tabular, plot, a shiny web abb is a great way of bringing a model to life.
